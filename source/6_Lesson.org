- You're going to be given very little support with this task, but you will have a structured English algorithm to help you through.
- Create a program for the microcontroller using a flowchart or GENIE BASIC, that will implement the following.
  1. When the button is pushed, the green LED comes on, to indicate the alarm is ready
  2. When the button is held down for three seconds
  3. The Buzzer sounds for one second and the LEDs flash on and off three times.
  4. The red LED remains on to indicate the buzzer is armed
  5. The program then waits for 5 seconds (for you to put the alarm away)
  6. The light level is recorded.
  7. The alarm then waits for the light level to increase significantly.
  8. If the light level increases, the buzzer sounds and the LEDs flash on and off
  9. Holding down the button for a further three seconds will turn off the alarm.

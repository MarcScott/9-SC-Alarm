- You've soldered enough PCBs together in the past that you should be able to construct this one with very little guidance.
- Use the image below as a guide along with the labels on the PCB, and be sure to solder in your components the correct way around.
[[file:img/board1.jpg]]
- You'll need to thread the PP3 battery snap through the strain hole, so it doesn't get ripped from your board.
file:img/board2.jpg
- Your switch, LEDS and the LDR will need to be on flying leads with heat-shrink protecting the solder joins.

- When it comes to soldering your LDR, this should be done last, as it needs threading through the top of the housing, prior to soldering.

** Badge It
:PROPERTIES:
:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS: badge
:END:
- Photograph both sides of your board.
- You will be awarded a silver, gold or platinum badge depending upon the quality of your soldering, flying leads and component placement.

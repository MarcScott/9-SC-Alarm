- Although the circuit you've designed should be fine, we need to make a few changes before we design a PCB
- Firstly we want to use a 9V supply (as they're cheaper), so we'll need a voltage regulator.
- Modify your circuit so you use the setup below to provide power.

- Check with your teacher that your circuit is correct before proceeding.
** Try It

- You're now going to design your own PCB.
- Initially you just need to follow this guide.
- Click on this button to begin the PCB Wizard
[[file:img/analogueCirc10.png]]
- Click on =Next=

- Choose =Single Sided/Thin Tracks= and check the box to allow customisation of the board.

- The default size of the board will be fine
file:img/analogueCirc13.png
- As will the default components
file:img/analogueCirc14.png
- And we need to use small pads
file:img/analogueCirc15.png
- Lastly uncheck the box, so that we can place components ourselves.

- Click convert and you should have something that looks a little like this.

- It's now up to you to try and create the PCB.
- You'll be awarded your badge depending on the size and neatness of your finished design.
- A silver badge will be awarded if you create a viable PCB of any size, without using jump wires.
- A gold badge will be awarded if you create a viable PCB no larger than 100mm by 100mm, without using jump wires.
- A platinum badge will be awarded if you create a viable PCB no larger than 50mm by 50mm, without using jump wires.
